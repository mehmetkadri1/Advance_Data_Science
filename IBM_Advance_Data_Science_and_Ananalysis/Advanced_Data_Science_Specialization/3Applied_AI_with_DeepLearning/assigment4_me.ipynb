Therefore we want you to understand how to migrate from a numpy program to a SystemML DML program. Don't worry. We will give you a lot of hints. Finally, you won't need this knowledge anyways if you are sticking to Keras only, but once you go beyond that point you'll be happy to see what's going on behind the scenes.\n\nSo the first thing we need to ensure is that we are on the latest version of SystemML, which is 1.2.0:\n\nThe steps are:\n- pip install\n- start execution at the cell with the version - check"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from IPython.display import Markdown, display\ndef printmd(string):\n    display(Markdown('# <span style=\"color:red\">'+string+'</span>'))\n\n\nif ('sc' in locals() or 'sc' in globals()):\n    printmd('<<<<<!!!!!
